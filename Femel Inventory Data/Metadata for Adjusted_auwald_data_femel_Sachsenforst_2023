## This file includes the metadata for the 2023 inventory of the oak femels. Note that the data in the second tab "Adjusted_data" was used for the analysis. The adjusted data simply includes the reclassification of some oak trees and condenses the raw data to only include plots where oak femels were planted. 

## PlotID: the identifier for each of the plots according to Sachsenforst. The Pau√ünitz plot is the smallest femel located in the southern part of the forest (separate from the other four plots)

## TreeID: the identifier for each unique tree that was measured. TreeID's start over from 1 for each of the PlotID's.

## StemID: the identifier for each unique stem in case trees had a fork below breast-height when measuring DBH. Ultimately, no trees forked below DBH, hence all rows have a StemID of "1."

## Species: the identifier for each type of observed tree species. The observed species codes are as follows:
###  - SEI: Pedunculate oak / Quercus robur
###  - EI?: Oak (later determined to be pedunculate oak)
###  - Walnuss: Walnut / Juglans regia
###  - HBU: European hornbeam / Carpinus betulus
###  - WLI: Small-leaved lime / Tilia cordata
###  - BAH: Sycamore maple / Acer pseudoplatanus
###  - HOL: Elder / Sambucus nigra

## Species_Adjusted : the identifier for each type of observed tree species, corrected for the oak trees that were later determined to be pedunculate oak / Quercus robur. The species codes are the same as above.

## DBH_mm: the diameter-at-breast-height for each observed tree in millimeters.

## Shaded: whether or not each observed tree was shaded by other trees or not (ie. whether each tree was in the overstory or understory). The observed codes are as follows:
### - y: shaded / in the understory
### - n: not shaded / in the overstory
### - p: partially shaded; these trees were excluded from analysis

## Comments: this column includes any notable characteristics (in German) of the observed trees. Namely, it was noted whether trees were dying, cracked, or growing at a strong angle.
